# Truly Automated Ships

This mod intends to change the way AI officers assigned to automated ships affect the rest of your fleet.

In the vanilla game, AI officers increase the "automated ship points" of the ship they're attached to, and to me it doesn't make sense.
If your automated fleet relies on the computing power of the rest of the fleet to coordinate itself - and that's why having too many automated ships leads to a decrease in maximum efficiency for all of them - then grabbing a tonne of GPUs and stitching them together with a ship should actually lift some of the weight from your regular ships, not add even more!

With this mod, when you slap a supercomputer on a hull, it will actually make the ship more autonomous, and decrease its "automated ship points," leaving you with the ability to increase the size of your automated fleet even more!
But beware: all of this added computing power will require constant maintenance. After all, you wouldn't expect a giant AI core with the capacity to manage entire planets to be easy to sustain, would you? The good news is that small ships will be reasonably cheap, but as hull size increases, so does maintenance costs.


## Let's talk numbers

This mod will apply a reduction to the "automated ship points" of any ship outfitted with an AI core. The reduction will depend on the type of core:
- Alpha core: 75%
- Beta core: 50%
- Gamma core: 25%

Having an AI core as an officer will also cause a hefty increase to its monthly supply cost:
- Alpha core base increase: +150%
- Beta Core base increase: +100%
- Gamma Core base increase: +50%

A multiplier will be applied to this base increase depending on hull size:
- Freighters: 1x
- Destroyers: 1.25x
- Cruisers: 1.5x
- Capitals: 2x


## v1.1 changelog

- Changed base maintenance increase from 300/200/100 to 150/100/50
- Added hull size multiplier
- Added tooltip on the "Automated Ship" hullmod to explain the increase in cost
- Changed "Automated Ships" skill description accordingly
